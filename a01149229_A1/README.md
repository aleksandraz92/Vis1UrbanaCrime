VIS Assignment 1


So first what I did is that I made empty html, js, css file.. At the beginning I did everything in .html and at the end I put code in right places. 
For me the hardest part was to take coordinates from String[ ARRESTEE HOME CITY MAP ], because I dont have any expirience in JavaScript.. I saw lots of examples in Stackoverflow, so it helped me. 
I used the URBANA coordinates from csv and put it in code and I googled a coordinates from hole USA and scale with it so at the end my visualisation should look nice. 
I created lines and circles based on my Data ( coordinates Urbana and other cities)
I also showed  an axes for my data, and on mouseover on the circle - the city label appears. I took an idea from http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/a22c42db65eb00d4e369 to make mouseover  
And also I used  another column  to color the lines ( in my case its COLUMN ARRESTEE SEX ) => and the black lines representing male  the red lines - woman and the steelblue for unknown
